# üé® F√§rgton üí°

F√§rgton (Swedish for hue/tint/tone) is a Philips Hue bridge exposing Hemtj√§nst
lights, light groups and sensors. It emulates a second generation Hue bridge
(the square one).

Please note that many endpoints will be read-only, despite the fact that on a
real bridge they might allow for modification. Only things that can normally
be controlled through Hemtj√§nst, like on/off state, colour etc. will be
controllable through this bridge.

It supports:

* [ ] Philips Hue REST API
    * [x] Discovery
        * [x] mDNS (DNS Service Discovery / zeroconf / Bonjour)
        * [x] SSDP (UPnP)
        * [x] `/description.xml`
    * [x] Authentication / Registration
    * [x] Configuration
        * Is read-only except for adding/deleting an entry from the whitelist
    * [x] Lights
    * [x] Groups
        * One group, a room, is created per light
        * Will be controllable once Hemtjanst gains a groups concept
    * [x] ~~Schedules~~
        * Returns empty
        * Use [Node-RED][nodered] for this
    * [x] ~~Scenes~~
        * Returns empty
        * Use [Node-RED][nodered] for this
    * [ ] Sensors
        * Only returns the hardcoded daylight sensor for now
    * [x] ~~Rules~~
        * Returns empty
        * Use [Node-RED][nodered] for this
    * [x] ~~Resource links~~
        * Returns empty since there is nothing right now to group multiple
          resources together
    * [x] Capabilities
* [ ] Philips Hue Entertainment API

## Supported applications

Due to the implementation of SSDP and mDNS any application that follows the
[Hue Bridge Discovery][hbd] will be able to find this device. Some
implementations assume the API runs on port 80 and won't work if you run
F√§rgton on a different port.

### Official Hue app

This has only been tested with the Hue 3.18+ Android and iOS apps. It's
known to crash the 3.10

For the official Hue app to work with F√§rgton you'll need to bind the bridge
on port 80 for plain text traffic and port 443 for TLS encrypted traffic.

When the Hue app first connects it will fetch `http://ip:80/api/nouser/conf`
and switch to HTTPS after that. If you don't enable HTTPS the official Hue
app will not work.

#### üîê Generating TLS certificates

You'll need to generate a public/private keypair for the bridge. It's
important to note that the MAC address of the bridge becomes part of the
TLS certificate so if you change `-bridge.mac-address` you'll need to
generate a new certificate.

First create an `openssl.conf`:

```text
[ req ]
default_bits            = 1024
default_md              = sha256
default_keyfile         = privkey.pem
distinguished_name      = req_distinguished_name
attributes              = req_attributes
req_extensions  = v3_req
x509_extensions = usr_cert

[ usr_cert ]
basicConstraints=critical,CA:FALSE
subjectKeyIdentifier=hash
authorityKeyIdentifier=keyid,issuer
keyUsage = critical, digitalSignature, keyEncipherment
extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth

[ v3_req ]
extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth, clientAuth, codeSigning, emailProtection
basicConstraints = CA:FALSE
keyUsage = nonRepudiation, digitalSignature, keyEncipherment

[ req_distinguished_name ]

[ req_attributes ]
```

Now generate the certs:

```bash
$ mac="mac address of bridge"
$ serial="${mac:0:2}${mac:3:2}${mac:6:2}fffe${mac:9:2}${mac:12:2}${mac:15:2}"
$ dec_serial=`python3 -c "print(int(\"$serial\", 16))"`
$ openssl req -new -config openssl.conf  -nodes -x509 -newkey  ec -pkeyopt ec_paramgen_curve:P-256 -pkeyopt ec_param_enc:named_curve   -subj "/C=NL/O=Philips Hue/CN=$serial" -keyout private.key -out public.crt -set_serial $dec_serial -days 3650
...
```

Pass the path to the public and private keys to `-bridge.tls-public-key` and
`-bridge.tls-private-key` respectively.
